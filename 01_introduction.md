## Introduction

The Meta Oversight Board was established in 2020 as an unprecedented experiment in corporate self-regulation, charged with providing independent review of Facebook and Instagram takedown decisions. Yet from its inception, questions have arisen about both the timeliness and representativeness of its work. Technology journalist Casey Newton criticized the Board’s slow deliberations—arguing they leave affected users waiting for relief long after the harm has occurred (Newton, 2023). At the same time, Robera Hamda revealed how Facebook’s “Dangerous Individuals and Organizations” blacklist disproportionately jeopardized Oromo users in Ethiopia, underscoring the risks of opaque, under-scrutinized enforcement (Hamda, 2021).

Scholars have echoed these concerns. Evelyn Douek observes that, despite its formal legitimacy, the Board routinely sidesteps its most contentious cases and lacks clear metrics to assess its own impact, resulting in a “formalistic” oversight that falls short of substantive goals (Douek, 2024). Complementing this critique, Wong and Floridi develop a holistic framework that captures the Board’s gains—increased transparency and policy influence—alongside its limitations, including constrained jurisdiction, Meta’s ultimate control over precedents, and stakeholder diversity gaps (Wong & Floridi, 2022).

> **Research Question**  
> How proportional and representative is the Oversight Board’s caseload across content topics and geographic regions, and how do decision-turnaround times vary accordingly?

By quantitatively mapping topic and regional distributions and measuring latency from appeal to ruling, I aim to identify patterns of under-representation or delay. Our goal is to provide evidence-based recommendations to strengthen the Board’s effectiveness in delivering prompt, equitable, and rights-respecting content governance.
